# myPhDResearch
This repo hosts an introduction to my PhD research at https://cce.engineering.osu.edu/
I will try to update this introduction and make it easy to understand.
Currently, my PhD thesis on the combustion model development in internal combustion engines is included in this repo.

For my PhD research, we use high-fidelity models and supercomputers to simulate the combustion processes in IC engines. The programming languages we use are mainly Fortran and C. I also used Python and Matlab for calculation and postprocessing data. In the development of high-fidelity (robust, accurate, and efficient) numerical models, I developed my expertise on statistical analysis, numerical methods, linear algebra, PDEs, etc. In the implementation and integration of our models into softwares, I developed my expertise on TDD, CI/CD, algorithms, data structure, computer architecture, and parallel computing, etc.
